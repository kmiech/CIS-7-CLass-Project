# CIS-7-CLass-Project
Team project for CIS 7

Created the branch for readme.md and testing.

Thank you for choosing our Vegenere Program created by George, Chris, and Seth.
The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series
interwoven Caeser ciphers, based on letters of a keyword.

After initial run please select from the options in the screen. Your options are:
1. Encrypt a message
2. Decrypt a message
3. Exit the program

If you choose 1, you will be prompted to enter a message to encrypt.
Once you enter a message it will then prompt you to enter a key word 
for the encryption. If you don't enter a keyword, "blank" will be your
default keyword.

If you choose 2 and have encrypted a previous message, you will be given 
the option to decrypt the last message or decrypt a new message.

If you choose to decrypt a message and haven't encrypted a message yet, you
will be prompted to enter a message to be decrypted.

You will be given those options until you choose to quit the program.
Thank you for using the program.

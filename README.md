# CIS-7-CLass-Project
Team project for CIS 7

Created the branch for readme.md and testing.

Thank you for choosing our Vegenere Program created by George, Chris, and Seth.
The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series
interwoven Caeser ciphers, based on letters of a keyword.

After initial run please select from the options in the screen. Your options are:
1. Encrypt a message
2. Decrypt a message
3. Exit the program

If you choose 1, you will be prompted to enter a message to encrypt. Once you enter
a message it will then prompt you to enter a key word for the encryption.
